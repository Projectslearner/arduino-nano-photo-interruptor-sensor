# Photo Interrupter Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Photo Interrupter Sensor project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Nano to interface with a photo interrupter sensor. This sensor consists of an infrared LED and a photodetector, which are positioned facing each other. When an object obstructs the path between the LED and the photodetector, the sensor detects the interruption and provides a digital output signal.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Photo Interrupter Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Photo Interrupter Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the digital output of the photo interrupter sensor to pin 2 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Ensure proper power and ground connections for the photo interrupter sensor.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the photo interrupter sensor to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Power Supply:**
   - Ensure the power supply connected to the photo interrupter sensor is appropriate for its voltage requirements.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

4. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - The serial monitor will display whether the sensor is blocked or unblocked based on the presence or absence of an obstruction in the sensor's path.

#### Applications

- **Object Detection:** Detect objects passing through a specific point.
- **Counting Mechanisms:** Count objects passing through a predefined area.
- **Conveyor Belt Monitoring:** Monitor the movement of objects on a conveyor belt.

#### Notes

- Ensure proper alignment of the LED and photodetector of the photo interrupter sensor.
- Adjust the sensitivity of the sensor by adjusting the distance between the LED and the photodetector.
- The code provided assumes a digital output from the sensor. If your sensor provides an analog output, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
